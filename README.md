# VideoClassifier
Classifies Videos for Music Box into One a Few Categories

Tentatively: I'm thinking of Shitpost/Meme, Tohou/Weeb, Legit/Music, Miscellaneous

But mainly this is an alert system for shitposts. I intend to include ensemble learning to combine different sources: the video, the thumbnail, the sound, and the title. I may also write in some custom code as well to help detect shitposts.

Custom detectors:
1. Rapid changes in volume for shitposts
2. word matching for known words (tohou, japanese common phrases)
3. anime girl thumbnails
4. language of title

I intend to roll out the initial version with only title and maybe thumbnail/audio detection.
